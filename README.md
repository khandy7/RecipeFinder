# Recipe Finder
- Search for recipes based on ingredients in your fridge
- Search for recipes based on cuisine type
- Save recipes for later and rate the ones you have made
- Add friends and view their saved recipes and ratings


### Release Notes
- Some ingredients when viewing a recipe do not get counted as being in Virtual Pantry due to varying ingredient names (ie. 'tomatoes' will not get counted as 'roma tomatoes')
- To search for additional recipes on the Find Recipes page you must reclick the 'Search' button
- Must create an account and login to be able to access all features


### Version 2 Features to Add
- Add 'Load More' button on the Find Recipes page
- Fix issue with some ingredients not being accounted for on View Recipe page
- Add search bar to Virtual Pantry page to be able to search for ingredients to add easier
- Add substitution options for ingredients when viewing a recipe
- Passwords are currently hashed and stored in DB, I would like to switch to a third party authentication service as it provides better security than my currrent implementation
